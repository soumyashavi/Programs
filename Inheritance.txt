
Inheritance

acquiring thr features of one class to another class is called as inheritance
-> to avoid code redencecy


class A  ----super class/Base class


Class B-------child class/child class

The class from which we inherit the features is called as super class or parent class
The class which inherit the features is called as child class or sub class
If super class object is created then it can have access to the feautures of super class only
If Sub class object is created then it can access both child class and parent class.

Types Of inheritance

1.single level

Super

Sub

Sytenx:

class super{
---
---
}

class sub extends super{
--
--}

2.Multi level
super

sub1

sub2

syntax:

class super{
}
class sub1 extends super{
}
class sub2 extends super{
}

3.Multiple inheritance is not possible

super1  super2
     sub
	 
	 
4.Hirerechial inheritance

    super
sub1  sub2 sub3 ----


class super{
}
class sub1 extends super{
}
class sub2 extends super{
}


5.Hybrid inhertance

   super

  sub1   sub2
  
  sub3   sub4 sub5


Class Super{
}
Class sub1 extend super{
}
class sub2 extends super{
}
class sub3 	extends sub1{
} 
class sub4 extends sub2{
}
class sub5 extends sub4[
]
